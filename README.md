# Amoeba

This is my solution to the assignment **Amoeba** of class **software developement 1**, written in Java.

More information can be seen in the comments of the source code.

### Requirements:

This program consists of one class: Class **Amoeba** is a microscopic tiny creature. It has an final gender and a size.

#### Class Amoeba

These little creatures can eat to gain additional size or hunger to decrease their size. Also they can split so that both amoebas have the same gender and same size added together like the single amoeba before. They can mate to create a new amoeba and fight. But only the male amoebas can fight against each other. The winner gets the losers's size added and the loser gets a size of 1.
